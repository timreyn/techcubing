# Imported google.protobuf dependencies

The protobuf-lite package does not provide common protobuf dependencies.  As a workaround, for java compilation, we add wire-compatible protos here under google/protobuf.

These protos are derived from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/any.proto.
